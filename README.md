# xoken-node
The Xoken Nexa node indexes & serves the Bitcoin SV blockchain with high efficiency and unlimited scale. Nexa's forte is its ability to serve SPV proofs trivially & efficiently even as blocks grow many orders of magnitude larger.

As a network gateway it is bilingual & operates at the edge of the Bitcoin P2P and Xoken P2P overlay networks. The Nexa node is self-sufficient & does not require bitcoind alongside it.
